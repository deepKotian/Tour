         Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century 
         and was, by 1822, a town of some 700–800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the 
         rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.
         In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi 
         and established themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and 
         Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum 
         to establish the Maktoum dynasty

         In 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, forcing residents to relocate 
         east to Deira.In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family 
         homes were still constructed from barasti – palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half the houses 
         of Bur Dubai, while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, 
         more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently 
         put to death.

         Despite a lack of oil, Dubai's ruler from 1958, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, used revenue 
         from trading activities to build infrastructure. Private companies were established to build and 
         operate infrastructure, including electricity, telephone services and both the ports and airport 
         operators.An airport of sorts (a runway built on salt flats) was established in Dubai in the 1950s 
         and, in 1959, the emirate's first hotel, the Airlines Hotel, was constructed. This was followed by 
         the Ambassador and Carlton Hotels in 1968.

         After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi, oil was eventually 
         discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first 
         field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's 
         infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, 
         mainly Asians and Middle easterners. Between 1968 and 1975 the city's population grew by over 300%

         During the 1970s, Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade, even as 
         the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war. Border disputes between 
         the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE; it was only in 1979 that a formal 
         compromise was reached that ended disagreements. The Jebel Ali port, a deep-water port that 
         allowed larger ships to dock, was established in 1979. The port was not initially a success, so 
         Sheikh Mohammed established the JAFZA (Jebel Ali Free Zone) around the port in 1985 to provide foreign 
         companies unrestricted import of labour and export capital. Dubai airport and the aviation industry 
         also continued to grow.
